# Ernie + Bert

Internal tooling for tracking equipment tickets. Discord threads are the
single source of truth. Ernie mirrors them into SQLite and posts updates
back; Bert is a desktop board on top of Ernie's HTTP API.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `ernie_sync.py` | Discord → SQLite. Read-only against Discord. Runs as a loop. |
| `ernie_extract.py` | Parsing. Pure functions over dicts, no I/O, no network. |
| `ernie_load.py` | Writes extracted records into SQLite. Idempotent. |
| `ernie_api.py` | FastAPI over the database. Everything Bert talks to. |
| `ernie_outbox.py` | The **only** thing that posts to Discord. |
| `bert.py` | PySide6 client. |
| `schema.sql` | Applied on every `connect()`. All `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`. |
| `seed_test_server.py` | Builds realistic test threads. Test guild only. |
| `wipe_test.py` | Deletes all threads in the test channel. Test guild only. |
| `ernie_backup.py` | Online SQLite backup with rotation. |
| `q.py` | Ad-hoc SQL helper. |
| `run.sh` | Starts the whole stack. `./run.sh test bert` |

## Hard rules

- **Never test against production.** Always `--env ernie-test.env --db ernie-test.db`.
- **All Discord writes go through `Discord.write()`.** The guild guard lives
  there so no code path can skip it. Never add a direct `http.post` or
  `http.patch` to Discord anywhere else.
- `ALLOW_DISCORD_WRITES` must exactly equal `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` or nothing
  posts. Production's env file does not contain the line at all.
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":` stays at the very end of every file.**
  `uvicorn.run()` blocks, so anything appended below it never registers.
  This has already caused a "route not found" bug once.
- **Keep sync transactions short.** `ernie_sync` commits per thread. Bert
  writes to the same database, and a long transaction causes
  `database is locked`.
- **Never hard-delete from the mirror.** Discord is mutable, so
  `thread_titles` and `message_revisions` are append-only and deletions set
  `deleted_at`. Bert's own state (`cards`, `events`) is never overwritten by
  a re-sync.
- **Compare timestamps with `datetime()` on both sides in SQL.** Python
  writes ISO8601 with a `T`; SQLite's `datetime('now')` uses a space. Raw
  string comparison is always false. This silently broke the outbox once.
- Secrets live in `ernie.env` / `ernie-test.env`, both gitignored. Never put
  a token in a `.py` file.

## Data model notes

- Key everything on `thread_id`. Titles change (PROD ↔ OPS renames are
  normal), so nothing may be keyed on parsed title fields.
- Priority bands: `unassigned`, `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`. New
  threads land in `unassigned`; a human drags them out. Ties within a band
  are broken by a shared fractional `rank`.
- Ticket embeds carry no priority signal — `Priority` is always "High" and
  `Labels` always "Operations" in real data. Priority is set by hand in Bert.
- `-- not found --` in an embed and `####` in an equipment ID are *pending*
  states, not errors. Amber, not red. Red is for genuinely unreadable titles.
- Ticket `Existing Return ticket(s) referenced in this thread (N)` has a
  varying count in the field name — match by prefix, not exact name.
- `#customer-threads` generates cards. `#customer-support` is mirrored for
  history only (`generate_cards = 0`).
- Archived means done: a keepalive bot pings live threads every three days,
  so nothing goes quiet by accident.

## Writes and undo

Every change writes one row to `events`. That single table backs the
activity feed, undo, and the outbox.

- `dispatch_after` = when Ernie may post. `NULL` means never post.
- Undo inside the window deletes nothing from Discord because nothing was
  ever sent. Undo after it posts a correction message instead.
- Edits are **batched**: saving four fields writes one event and posts one
  message. Do not split this into per-field events.
- Writes take an idempotency `key`; retries return the original result.

## Running

```bash
./run.sh test bert          # sandbox: sync + outbox + api + bert
./run.sh prod               # production: sync + api only, no outbox
python ernie_sync.py --once --env ernie-test.env --db ernie-test.db
```

Environment: Windows, Git Bash (MINGW64), Python 3.13, SQLite in WAL mode.

## Style

Match what's there: standard library first, `httpx` for HTTP, dataclasses for
records, plain functions over classes unless state demands it. Comments
explain *why*, not *what*. No new dependencies without a reason.

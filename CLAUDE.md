# Ernie + Bert

Internal tooling for tracking equipment tickets. Discord threads are the
single source of truth. Ernie mirrors them into SQLite and posts updates
back; Bert is a desktop board on top of Ernie's HTTP API.

## Files

| `TESTING.md` | Hand this to the tester. Both setups, start to finish. |

## Hard rules

- **Never test against production.** Always `--env ernie-test.env --db ernie-test.db`.
- **All Discord writes go through `Discord.write()`.** The guild guard lives
  there so no code path can skip it. Never add a direct `http.post` or
  `http.patch` to Discord anywhere else.
- `ALLOW_DISCORD_WRITES` must exactly equal `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` or nothing
  posts. Production's env file does not contain the line at all.
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":` stays at the very end of every file.**
  `uvicorn.run()` blocks, so anything appended below it never registers.
  This has already caused a "route not found" bug once.
- **Keep sync transactions short.** `ernie_sync` commits per thread. Bert
  writes to the same database, and a long transaction causes
  `database is locked`.
- **Never hard-delete from the mirror.** Discord is mutable, so
  `thread_titles` and `message_revisions` are append-only and deletions set
  `deleted_at`. Bert's own state (`cards`, `events`) is never overwritten by
  a re-sync.
- **Compare timestamps with `datetime()` on both sides in SQL.** Python
  writes ISO8601 with a `T`; SQLite's `datetime('now')` uses a space. Raw
  string comparison is always false. This silently broke the outbox once.
- Secrets live in `ernie.env` / `ernie-test.env`, both gitignored. Never put
  a token in a `.py` file.

## Data model notes

- Key everything on `thread_id`. Titles change (PROD ↔ OPS renames are
  normal), so nothing may be keyed on parsed title fields.
- Priority bands: `unassigned`, `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`. New
  threads land in `unassigned`; a human drags them out. Ties within a band
  are broken by a shared fractional `rank`.
- **`rank` is the order, and it is the only one.** A thread nobody can read
  (`ex.UNREADABLE_CONFIDENCE`) is ranked to the *top* of unassigned by
  `ensure_card`, not the bottom, because it needs a person soonest. Bert used
  to arrange that at draw time instead: the card sat first on screen and
  twelfth in the state channel, and a drop between two visible cards was
  measured against neighbours that were not its neighbours. Nothing may sort
  a band by anything but `rank` -- if a card belongs somewhere, give it the
  rank that puts it there. Dragging one down leaves it down; a later rename
  to something unreadable does not haul it back up.
- Work is a list, not a field: `work_items`, one row per bubble on the card.
  Rows are never deleted — a tick in view mode sets `done_at`, an ✕ in the
  editor sets `removed_at`, and undo needs both rows still there. The editor
  sends `work_add` / `work_remove`, not the whole list, so two people adding
  different items merge instead of colliding.
- **A retired queue is parsed, never offered.** `QUEUES` is every prefix a
  title may legitimately start with and drives `_PREFIX`, so nothing may be
  taken out of it because it fell out of use: the titles already in the mirror
  would stop matching, fall to `UNREADABLE_CONFIDENCE`, and be ranked to the
  *top* of unassigned as cards nobody can read. `QUEUES_OFFERED` is what Bert's
  editor offers, and `T.QUEUE` must hold exactly those -- the filter checkboxes
  are built by walking the palette, so a tag with no colour also has no filter.
  `tests/check_palette.py` holds the two together. DATA was retired 2026-09
  with one thread in the sandbox and one in production still carrying it; the
  editor keeps a retired tag on a card that already has it rather than
  silently clearing it on the next save.
- `cards.action_item`, `build_state`, `return_state` and `direction` are
  retired — work items replaced all four. Nothing shows or edits them; they
  stay only so undo can reach an old `edited` event.
- Ticket embeds carry no priority signal — `Priority` is always "High" and
  `Labels` always "Operations" in real data. Priority is set by hand in Bert.
- `-- not found --` in an embed and `####` in an equipment ID are *pending*
  states, not errors. Amber, not red. Red is for genuinely unreadable titles.
- Ticket `Existing Return ticket(s) referenced in this thread (N)` has a
  varying count in the field name — match by prefix, not exact name.
- `#customer-threads` generates cards. `#customer-support` is mirrored for
  history only (`generate_cards = 0`).
- Archived means done: a keepalive bot pings live threads every three days,
  so nothing goes quiet by accident.

## Writes and undo

Every change writes one row to `events`. That single table backs the
activity feed, undo, and the outbox.

- `dispatch_after` = when Ernie may post. `NULL` means never post.
- Priority moves are silent except in or out of `critical`, which posts. Every
  other band change, and every reorder within a band, is board housekeeping:
  posting each nudge between high and medium is noise in a customer thread.
- A **`reordered`** event carries the band and the card's position in it,
  before and after, as `band:position` in `old_value` / `new_value` --
  `high:5` -> `high:3`, which reads as "High 5th -> 3rd". Not the rank: that is
  a fraction and "1000 -> 1500" tells a reader only that something moved. Both
  values carry the band, though a reorder never leaves one, so either is
  readable on its own; `ex.reorder_spot()` parses them and returns a bare
  position for the rows written before the band was recorded. The
  positions have to be worked out where the move happens, against the ranks it
  is ordered among, because afterwards those ranks have moved on and it is no
  longer derivable. Rows written before this carry nothing and are shown
  without the places rather than being given invented ones. **A drag that lands
  a card back where it started writes no event at all** -- the rank is still
  saved so both boards agree, but four identical lines for a card that never
  went anywhere is the feed reporting the dragging rather than the outcome.
- Undo inside the window deletes nothing from Discord because nothing was
  ever sent. Undo after it posts a correction message instead.
- Edits are **batched**: saving four fields writes one event and posts one
  message. Do not split this into per-field events. The feed still says which
  it was: `old_value` is the previous value of everything that moved plus a
  `__work__` entry naming the bubbles added and removed, so Bert reads the
  shape off it -- bubbles only, fields only, or both -- and `new_value` is the
  prose it shows. A row whose `old_value` won't parse falls back to "edited"
  rather than being dropped.
- **A feed row opens only when clipping actually hid something.** The line is
  rendered twice, clipped and whole, and the two being different is the test --
  no layout measuring, and no affordance on the rows that already say
  everything. Which rows are open is held on the window by `event_id`, not on
  the widgets: `_render_feed` throws every row away and builds it again on each
  poll, so a row opened to read would shut again within five seconds.
- **In a feed row the text is what gives way, never the controls.** An
  unwrapped `QLabel` cannot be made narrower than its text, so the row's
  minimum width was the whole line plus every fixed column -- 1644px inside a
  1000px window, measured -- and `feed_scroll` has its horizontal scrollbar
  off, so everything past the edge was cut away in silence. Undo is the last
  column, so Undo is what disappeared. The label is `QSizePolicy.Ignored`
  across, which lets it be squeezed to nothing before any control is touched,
  and the chevron sits in its own column rather than on the end of the line it
  would be clipped with. The window's minimum width is its opening width: below
  that the fixed columns crowd the line out and the bands are too tight to drop
  into.
- **A closed feed row never word-wraps.** `_fit_feed` takes the height every
  row is held to from the closed rows' `sizeHint()`, and a wrapped `QLabel`
  reports its hint at a heuristic width of its own rather than the width the
  layout will give it -- 112px against 14 for the same line. Wrapping them all
  put that into `_feed_row_h`, the panel grew to fit eight-line rows, and since
  that height was a running maximum it could only ever get worse: clicking
  anything made the feed swallow the window. An open row wraps and takes its
  height from the label's `heightForWidth`, because `sizeHint()` under-reports
  the other way there and clips the text the row was opened to show.
- **Nothing in the feed moves vertically unless the text needs the room.** The
  height rows are held to is the tallest of them -- a row carrying an Undo
  button, 20px against 12 for the text alone -- and it is held steady rather
  than re-measured, or it would drop the moment the last undoable row aged out
  and slide the list up while somebody was reading it. That same height is the
  *floor* for an open row: released to its natural size, a row with no Undo
  button collapsed to the smaller one, so opening a line to read four more
  characters pulled everything below it upward. Opening a row now either
  changes nothing or adds exactly the lines the text needs. Holding the height
  steady is only safe because closed rows never wrap, which is the invariant
  above.
- **The clip scales with the window, capped at half of it.** A closed row is
  cut to 46 characters of thread and 44 of detail at the narrowest, and those
  widths are scaled up together by `_feed_scale()` so a full-screen board is
  not clipping lines with half the row still empty. Half the window, not the
  space available: a line run the full width of a wide screen is further than
  the eye tracks, and the whole of it is one click away. It measures
  `FEED_FONT_PX`, the size the row actually draws at -- `self.fontMetrics()` is
  the window's font, reports a wider character, and cancels the calculation
  out so a wide board clips at the narrow width anyway. The scale never falls
  below 1, so a narrow board reads exactly as it did.
- Writes take an idempotency `key`; retries return the original result.
- A thread opening in Discord writes a **`started`** event, so the feed can
  say where a card came from -- the one thing on it that nobody did in Bert.
  `dispatch_after` is NULL, because it happened in Discord already, and undo
  refuses it in both Bert and the API: there is nothing here to take back.
  The name is `threads.owner_id` resolved against `messages`, preferring
  Discord's `global_name` ("Tyler") to the username ("tyler_mazza"). A thread
  a bot opened gets no line -- the seeder makes two dozen at a time. Neither
  does one Ernie merely inherited: only a thread created within
  `WITNESSED_WITHIN_S` of being first seen counts, because a first sync makes
  a card for every thread there has ever been, and claiming to have watched
  those start would write a line per thread into the feed and the change log.

## The state channel

So two people on two machines share one board without either hosting the
other's API. Priority, rank, work items and completion live in
`#ernie-state` (`STATE_CHANNEL_ID`), one message per card, edited in place.

- **Not the thread title.** Measured in the sandbox: a message edit recovers
  from its rate limit in 0.67s and announces nothing; a thread rename allows
  two per ten minutes, comes back `scope: shared` so a second Ernie gets no
  budget of its own, and posts a system message into the customer thread
  every time. The standard rate-limit headers do not warn about the rename
  limit -- they read healthy right up to the 429.
- **One message per card, not one document.** Two people moving different
  cards edit different messages and never collide, and no card can outgrow
  the 2000-character content cap.
- Each message names its own `thread_id`, so the channel is self-describing
  and an interrupted publish resumes without duplicating.
- Everything above the fence is derived and never parsed back, so editing
  the prose in Discord cannot corrupt the board -- which is what lets it be
  chatty enough to read: band and position, the bubbles with ticked ones
  struck through, and who last touched it.
- One or more extra messages carry a **`**Board**` summary** -- the whole
  running order, in the same band order Bert shows, so the channel can be read
  top to bottom when checking two boards agree. It holds no state and is
  skipped by `parse()`. It **spans as many messages as it needs**: it used to
  be one, dropping rows off the bottom until the rest fit the 2000-character
  cap, so a board past about thirty cards silently stopped showing its lowest
  ranked few. Later pages start with `SUMMARY_MARK` too, so everything that
  finds or clears the summary finds them without being taught to, and only the
  first carries the stamp. Two boards crossing a page boundary in the same
  cycle can both post a last page; the next publish sees one too many and
  deletes it. Its only clock is the **last published** line, kept out of the
  comparison by `without_stamp()` and refreshed on its own heartbeat --
  otherwise it would differ on every publish and rewrite the message every
  cycle for nothing.
- A card message is rewritten when its state changes *or* when the prose
  would read differently, so changing `render()` re-renders the channel
  rather than leaving old cards in the old format forever.
- **The two directions live in different processes**, because
  `ernie_sync.py` is read-only against Discord and `ernie_outbox.py` is the
  only thing that writes there. Sync pulls the channel into SQLite; the
  outbox publishes SQLite into the channel.
- **Conflicts are resolved three-way against `state_sync`, never by
  comparing the two machines' clocks.** `state_sync` holds what this machine
  last agreed with the channel about, per card; against that base, the
  channel moved, we moved, both moved, or neither. Both moved means the
  channel wins -- it is the shared copy -- and the losing change is named in
  the feed rather than vanishing. A card with no base adopts the channel, so
  a board joining an existing session takes the shared state.
- Timestamps decide nothing. `cards.updated_at` is this machine's own clock
  and means "when this row changed here"; a remote `at` is only used to file
  the replayed event, clamped to now so a fast laptop can't park its changes
  at the top of the feed. `publish()` checks this machine against Discord's
  clock -- the one clock both share -- and says so past `SKEW_WARN_S`.
- **`state_sync` has two timestamps and only `agreed_at` is about the other
  board.** `synced_at` is the publish, which is this machine pushing its own
  view; it advances every cycle whether or not anything is coming back, so
  measuring contact with it reported "in step" with the sync loop stopped.
  `agreed_at` is written by `reconcile()` alone, on every card it compared
  including the two quiet outcomes, and is what `/health` and Bert's
  indicator report. NULL means published but never yet reconciled, which Bert
  shows as `no contact yet` rather than folding into "in step". The publish
  must never write it. **`no contact` is about this machine, not the other
  one.** `reconcile()` stamps every card it compares against the messages in
  the channel, and those sit in Discord whether or not the other laptop is on,
  so the clock advances on our own cycle regardless of anyone else's activity.
  The only thing that stalls it is our own sync stopping or losing Discord.
  Documentation that read it as "their stack is down" had it backwards, and
  sent the reader to ask the other person about a window on their own machine.
  The summary message says **last published**, not "last checked", for the same
  reason: it is one machine's write time, not an agreement between two.
- Applying a remote change writes an event with **`dispatch_after` NULL**.
  The machine that made the change already queued its own message; giving
  the replay a dispatch would post the same update twice, once per board.
- A card the channel knows and this machine has no row for is skipped, not
  invented -- its thread simply hasn't synced here yet.
- Completed cards stay in the channel carrying `completed: true`, so closing
  one propagates. Cards closed before the channel ever saw them are not
  backfilled.

## The change log

A durable record of every change, in its own channel, for looking back at
rather than reading as it goes. Customer threads only hear the handful of
changes worth interrupting somebody for; this gets all of them.

- **Inert unless `CHANGELOG_CHANNEL_ID` is set, and only one machine should
  set it.** Both boards hold the whole history -- their own changes and
  replays of the other's -- so two loggers write every line twice.
- SQLite -> Discord, so it rides with the outbox like the state publish does.
- Nothing is logged until it has **settled**: an event inside its undo window
  may still be cancelled, and a record that says things that never happened
  is worse than no record. A silent change -- every band move that isn't in
  or out of `critical`, and every reorder -- has no `dispatch_after`, which
  is not the same as being finished; it gets the same `UNDO_WINDOW_S`,
  measured from `occurred_at`. Reading NULL as settled logged the bulk of the
  board's activity instantly, ahead of the changes that do wait.
- An undone change is logged struck through, because that it was made and
  taken back is itself part of the record. Undo has no deadline, so waiting
  out the window is not enough on its own: a line already posted and undone
  later is **edited in place**, off `changelog_sent.sent_at` against
  `events.undone_at`. The edit re-stamps `sent_at`, which is what stops it
  being struck twice.
- `changelog_sent` tracks it per event rather than by a high-water mark: a
  change replayed from the other board carries the timestamp it originally
  happened at, so events do not arrive in `occurred_at` order and a cursor
  would step straight over them.
- The history already in the database is marked as logged **only on the very
  first run**, so switching the log on doesn't replay months into a channel
  nobody has read. Doing that on every start would silently swallow whatever
  happened while the logger was down. `--backfill` asks for the history.
- Nothing reads it back. Deleting the channel and unsetting the variable
  leaves nothing behind but a table nothing looks at.

## Running

```bash
./run.sh test bert          # sandbox: sync + outbox + api + bert
./run.sh test bert lan      # same, API reachable from other machines
./run.sh prod               # production: sync + api only, no outbox
python ernie_sync.py --once --env ernie-test.env --db ernie-test.db
```

## Testing with somebody else

Two ways, and they are not the same setup. `TESTING.md` is the version to
hand over.

**One backend, two Berts.** You run `./run.sh test bert lan`, which binds the
API to every interface and prints the address; they run `bert.cmd`, which
asks for it once and remembers it. They need Python and a clone -- no token,
no database, no migration -- and the board updates at Bert's 5s poll. Same
network only. In *this* setup they must not run `run.sh`: a second sync and
outbox with no `STATE_CHANNEL_ID` is a second board, not a shared one.

**Two full stacks.** Both run everything, sharing only `#ernie-state`.
Works across networks and neither laptop has to stay up for the other, at the
cost of a token on both machines and a board that is up to a sync cycle
behind. `STATE_CHANNEL_ID` is what makes it one board; `ALLOW_DISCORD_WRITES`
must equal `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` or their changes never leave their machine. A
machine joining with no `state_sync` rows adopts the channel, so a fresh
clone comes up already matching the shared board.

`ernie_state.py --check` is the preflight for the second setup and what
`stack.cmd` runs before starting anything: it catches a missing
`STATE_CHANNEL_ID`, a channel the bot can't reach, and a clock out by more
than `SKEW_WARN_S`. Clock skew is read from the `Date` header of a live
response -- an existing message's timestamp says when it was written, not
what time it is, so measuring against one reports its age as skew.

Bert shows which it is: the `shared board · …` indicator by the refresh
button appears only when `state_sync` has rows, and reports up to date,
waiting to send, or out of contact. It says "shared board" rather than just
"shared" because the label has to answer *what* it is talking about on its
own -- read cold, `shared · in step` told nobody what was in step with what.

The API has no authentication, so on `lan` anyone who can reach the port can
move cards and post to the thread. Trusted network, for as long as the test
lasts, never port-forwarded. `lan` is refused outright for `prod`.

Environment: Windows, Git Bash (MINGW64), Python 3.13, SQLite in WAL mode.

## Style

Match what's there: standard library first, `httpx` for HTTP, dataclasses for
records, plain functions over classes unless state demands it. Comments
explain *why*, not *what*. No new dependencies without a reason.

**No colour literals in Bert.** Every colour comes off `T`, the active
palette -- `T.INK`, `T.BAND_CARD[band]` -- and a new one has to be added to
both `LIGHT` and `DARK`. A hex typed into a stylesheet works in one theme and
is wrong in the other, silently, in whichever theme nobody happened to be
looking at. Settings offers light, dark, or following the desktop; changing it
rebuilds the window, because each widget styles itself where it is made and
there is no single sheet to swap -- and a stylesheet missed on a restyle is a
white panel in a dark board. `tests/check_palette.py` holds the two palettes
to the same keys, which is the invariant that keeps a theme from crashing only
for the person using the other one.
